This is the source code of [Replica Island](http://replicaisland.net), an open-source game developed by Chris Pruett and team in 2010.  The project was converted to a gradle project using Android Studio 1.0.

This project is used as a demo of [jimu Mirror](http://jimulabs.com), a plugin for Android Studio that provides live previews of layouts, animations and interactions on multiple devices.
